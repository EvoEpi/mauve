Version history for Mauve releases

 Version 1.3.0 (2006-05-22)

  New features:

  - Rearrangement history analysis by generalized transposition/block interchange, code courtesy of Mike Tsai.
    Use the green/blue/black toolbar button to perform an analysis.  
    For details on the inference algorithm see Yancopoulos, S., Attie, O and Friedberg, R. 
    "Efficient sorting of genomic permutations by translocation, inversion and block interchange"
    *Bioinformatics* 2005 21(16):3340-3346    

  - Rearrangement history through the GRIMM/MGR server now supported, use the red/yellow/black toolbar button.

  - No more limit on the number of input sequences.  This feature comes at the cost of increased memory consumption.
    Just because the limit has been removed doesn't mean that the alignment algorithm will do a good job handling
    a large number of sequences.

  - The mauveAligner command-line tool has the new option --lcb-match-input to extract matches from an existing
    alignment and use them as anchors when computing a new alignment.

  - MUSCLE has been upgraded to version 3.6.

  Bugs fixed:

  - MUSCLE on Windows now runs faster and uses less memory.

  - On unix, Mauve will search $PATH for mauveAligner.
 
 Version 1.2.3 (2005-10-20)

  New features:

  - Display each component of multi-part features (e.g. a multiple exon gene) as a linked series of boxes

  - Display repeat_region annotations from GenBank files

  - Improved load time for previously viewed alignments using a disk-based alignment cache

  - Added a help menu item that will clear the on-disk alignment cache

  - Colorized the similarity plots, grey was starting to depress our entire lab.

  - Support for highlighting arbitrary regions of the sequence by holding the shift key
    while clicking and dragging on the display

  - Faster nucleotide display when zoomed in closely

  Bug fixes:

  - Fixed GUI interface for setting the minimum seed size (Thanks to Bill Bruno and Todd Treangen)

  - Fixed mouseover, highlighting, and display alignment in the LCB display 
    mode (used when the 'Full Alignment' option is disabled)

 
 Version 1.2.2 (2005-06-11)

  New features:

  - Ability to set the reference genome

  - Displays gene name or locus tag for annotated features

  Bug fixes:

  - Uses less memory for MUSCLE alignments by restricting the size of segments aligned 
    by MUSCLE

  - Alignment editor shows original sequence coordinates when an aligned character is
    clicked

  - Handles GenBank files with a large number of sequence entries (e.g. C. hominis)

 Version 1.2.1 (2005-05-05)
  
  New features:

   - Experimental support for alignment editing using Cinema-MX
     Right click on an LCB to trigger the edit menu

   - Annotated features are shown in both forward and reverse complement orientation

   - When clicking an annotated feature, a database xref popup menu shows options for
     viewing the feature in known databases.  Currently supported databases are Entrez
     Protein and ASAPdb.  Please contact us about support for other databases.

   - Choice of either MUSCLE or Clustal in the GUI or on the command line with 
     the --gapped-aligner switch

  Bug fixes:

   - Database xref speed improvement

   - Features not shown when viewing large regions to improve speed

   - Fixed an off-by-one bug that crashed the viewer when loading Salmonella alignments

   - Eliminated extraneous MUSCLE warning messages on the Mac OS X console.

  Known issues:

   - In some cases MUSCLE on Windows can consume lots of system resources.  If 
     you are experiencing problems we suggest using Clustal for the time being.

 Version 1.2.0 (2005-04-20)

  New features:

   - **Image export**.  Mauve can export the current display view in JPEG, TIF, and 
     PNG formats at a user-defined resolution.

   - **MUSCLE Alignment**.  Mauve now calculates gapped alignments using the 
     "MUSCLE":http://www.drive5.com/muscle/ DNA alignment method.  Previously 
     Clustal-W was used to calculate gapped alignments.  MUSCLE provides 
     significantly improved speed and accuracy over Clustal-W

   - **Collinear genomes**.  When it is known that the genomes being aligned 
     have no rearrangements, select the 'Assume collinear genomes' option in the
     "Align sequences" window to tell Mauve that it should find the single best LCB.
     On the command line, this behavior can be invoked with the '--collinear' switch.

  Bug fixes:

   - Fixed a memory leak in LCB extension that could quickly consume all system memory.

   - The 1.1.0 Windows release used a large amount of memory because it was compiled 
     for use with 160 sequences instead of the usual 16.

   - Fixed a bug parsing GenBank sequences which had extra newlines in them

  Known issues:

   - On Mac OS X the muscle aligner generates lots of warning messages about not being
     able to open /proc/meminfo.  These messages can be ignored and will be eliminated
     in future releases.

 Version 1.1.0 (2005-03-30)

  New features:

  - Mauve can launch a web browser to show a web database entry for annotated 
    features that have a /db_xref qualifier in their GenBank entry.  Currently
    ASAPdb and NCBI's PubGene databases are supported.  Other databases
    may be added upon request.

  - Mauve bundles a text console display for informational and error messages.
    It can be viewed by selecting 'Show console' from the 'Help' menu.

  - Alignment generation has been multithreaded so that alignments can be
    generated while another alignment is being viewed.

  - A Print Preview and Page Layout dialog boxes provide greater control over
    printing.

  Bug fixes:

  - A bug in mauveAligner which resulting in a "bad alignment" error message has
    been fixed.

  - Printing has been fixed to provide accurate high resolution images.  Output is
    vectorized so images printed to PDF documents (e.g. using Acrobat or PDF995)
    can be easily embedded in publications and have a high quality look.

  - Screen space is used more economically when viewing a large number of sequences,
    allowing at least six genomes to display on a 1024x768 screen.  Previously only
    three genomes would fit on a screen of that size.

  - additional fixed bugs can be found in the Mantis tracker

 Version 1.0.1 (2005-03-08)

  Bug fixes:

  - Unable to align genomes on Mac OS X 10.3 (due to a missing library)

  - Unable to run Mauve under Linux (Mauve was not set as executable)

  - Unable to load genome annotations after constructing an alignment
    when the source GenBank files reside in a different directory than
    the alignment output

  - Lower memory profile.  Mauve now uses less memory when reading alignments,
    making the large Drosophila alignments available on the web site
    viewable on computers with over 1GB RAM. 


 Version 1.0 (2005-03-01)

  New features:

  - Display of annotated features such as CDS, rRNA, tRNA and misc_features
    from GenBank format files

  - Full support for Mac OS X

  - Display of chromosomal boundaries and contigs of incomplete genomes

  - Display of contig/chromosome name and sequence coordinates

  - Source code released under the GNU General Public License.  Mauve is now free 
    software and can be modified and redistributed freely (in accordance with the GPL). 

 2004-12-16

  Bug fixes:

  - Inter-LCB islands were (still) incorrect and are now fixed.  This bug was originally
    reported by Val Burland in Dec. 2003 but didn't get completely fixed until now.

  - Vertical only display resize fixed

  - Fixed a bug in the LCB info display when the LCB slider had been adjusted

  New Features:

  - Sequence similarity browsing in the display

  - More sensitive alignments by using inexact seeds.  This means Mauve can be used on
    more taxa simultaneously and also on more divergent taxa.

  - Display alignment in the similarity browser can be accomplished with a single mouse click

 2004-07-08

  Bug fixes:

  - Brought PDF documentation up-to-date

 2004-06-30

  Bug fixes:

  - Fixed several missing icon bugs in linux and windows releases

  - Mauve now requires Java 1.4 to function correctly, a warning message
    is displayed if Mauve detects an older version of Java

  New features:

  - Automatic checking for new releases, and on Windows, downloading the
    new release and starting the installer

  - Releases now include a User Guide in PDF format and a link to the online guide
  
 2004-05-18

  Bug fixes:

  - Fixed a bug that would result in unreasonably large print jobs

  New features:

  - Implemented interactive LCB weight adjustment.  This feature allows dynamic adjustment of
    the LCB weight within Mauve using a slider control.  As the minimum LCB weight is changed the
    display updates with the corresponding set of LCBs.
 
  - Added toolbar buttons for basic navigational controls such as scrolling and zooming the
    display.  Also added a color mode selector.
 
  - Added keyboard shortcuts for open (ctrl+o), close (ctrl+w), print (ctrl+p), and quit 
    (ctrl+q).
  
  Important changes:

  - The up and down arrows no longer zoom in and out, instead use ctrl+up and ctrl+down


 2004-04-26

  Bug fixes:

  - Fixed a bug that allowed users to zoom in too far

  - Fixed a bug that kept the screen from clearing after selecting 'close' from the File menu

  - Fixed a bug that would cause the display to become 'unaligned' after using the context
    menu to align the display and subsequently zooming out.

  - Fixed a bug that raised an exception when no matching regions were found among the
    sequences being aligned

  - Changed the .txt file extension to default to FastA file format instead of raw sequence data

  - Fixed a subtle bug that would occasionally cause a "horrible error" to be reported

  New features:

  - Improved the 'Align sequences' dialog interface to give the user an easy set of default
    values with optional control over the alignment parameters.  Also added an interface to 
    set the backbone parameters.

  - Added the ability to change ordering of genomes in the display using drag and drop.  To
    enter and leave reordering mode press the 'h' key.  When in reordering mode genomes can
    be dragged and dropped into the desired order.

 2004-02-19

  Bug fixes:

  - Fixed a bug in the island coordinate output that caused the end positions of inverted
    regions to be huge (wrong) numbers.  Removed obsolete -d and --stats command line options.
    Added a --id-matrix or -t command line option to print out an identity matrix.  Mauve
    now creates an identity matrix by default.

 2003-12-09

  Bug fixes:

  - Fixed another bug in the LCB extension code that occasionally resulted in incorrect
    alignments.

 2003-12-06

  Bug fixes:

  - Fixed a serious bug that caused the first sequence to be misaligned in regions with
    numerous gaps.

 2003-11-04

  Bug fixes:

  - Fixed a minor file format problem with XMFA (eXtended Multi-FastA) output.  Fixed a bug 
    with reverse complement backbone determination.

 2003-10-17

  Bug fixes:

  - Updated the GUI interface to match new command line options for the aligner.  The
    GUI was behaving badly in the 2003-10-08 release.  Full alignment is now selected
    by default, if no LCB weight is specified one will be chosen automatically.

 2003-10-08

  Bug fixes:

  - Final aligner debugging completed using thousands of test cases.  Numerous bugs
    were squashed.  The aligner should be (but isn't) rock solid now.  Removed file 
    I/O from the ClustalW code, resulting in vast speedups during recursive alignment.
    One more bug to kill.

 2003-09-13

  Bug fixes:

  - Debugged the LCB extension code, hopefully eliminating strange crashes from the previous
    release.

 2003-09-08

  New Features:

  - Added LCB extension code, allows Mauve to search for additional MUM anchors off the ends 
    of LCBs.  Increased the minimum anchor size to 5 b.p. to reduce spurious anchoring.

 2003-08-15

  New Features:

  - Added print menu item to the File menu
  - Clean-ups for Linux
  - Mauve for Linux is ready!

 2003-08-13

  Bug fixes:

  - Additional bugfixes for the recursive anchoring and alignment process.  Will this
    software ever be bug free?

 2003-08-02

  Bug fixes:

  - Fixed some serious bugs in the production of gapped alignments from Mauve style MUM 
    alignments.  This bug affected island predictions and backbone predictions of
    previous releases.

  New features:

  - Implemented Multi-FastA sequence input.  If a single sequence file is given Mauve
    assumes it is a Multi-FastA file where each sequence entry corresponds to a sequence
    to align.

 2003-07-31

  New features:

   - Implemented backbone identification -- backbone is any region of sequence conserved among
     all genomes under study.  Mauve's definition of backbone is any region longer than x base
     pairs that does not contain any gaps longer than x base pairs.  x is specified as the
     island size in the "Align Sequences..." window.

 2003-07-30

  Bug fixes:

  - Fixed a segfault in SML binary search

  New features:

  - Added end-gap penalties to clustal alignments

 2003-07-28

  - Fixed a few problems with Clustal Alignment -- more to come

 2003-07-25

  Bug fixes:

  - Changed the default maximum Clustal alignment size to 9000
  - Fixed numerous bugs related to recursive alignment and ClustalW alignment

  New features:

  - Now outputs alignments in Extended Multi-FastA (xmfa) format
